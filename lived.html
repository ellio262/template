		<h1>My Marketing Medium</h1>
		<p>An experience lived is a lesson learned. All throughout my life I have been exposed to countless new thoughts, experiences, and people that have all had an impact whether large- or small in leading me to where I am now. However, in this world that is immensely saturated in advanced technology nothing more has influenced my decision to begin studying business marketing then computers and their counterparts. Most people wouldn’t make a connection between these when considering what led a person to their career in marketing. I didn’t even put these two together initially as I began to brainstorm different kinds of technology that influenced me throughout my life. As I started to realize where and when I had been intrigued by not only marketing, but also business as a whole I concluded that although it wasn’t one solitary piece of technology to influence me all those that impacted me were very closely interconnected. Whether it was the ads, the simplistic creativity and manipulation now available to use for them, or the well planned out and perfectly executed incorporation of computers, phones, and televisions, worldwide marketing and advertising slowly began to stick into my mind. Never in my lifetime had I thought I would be pursuing business and marketing.</p>
		<p>As a child I had always wanted to be and architect or an engineer. I would spend countless hours researching famous architects and engineers and their works. My days would consist of watching television specials and hour long Google sessions trying to absorb all the facts and bits and pieces I could about any and all architecture and engineering. However, I never truly felt a spark when it came to pursing either of them as a career. Rather they always felt like more of a hobby to me which I now feel perfectly fine about however, a year ago I was truly torn about how I wanted to pursue my studies when I attended Michigan State University. It is during these years and hours I spent researching and watching specials that I feel I was most impacted by the marketing and advertising I was introduced to. What truly caught my eye when it came to marketing and advertising via electronic devices was the intricately placed messages and way every electronic device could be used in some way to connect to another increasing the ability to expand on the way one would advertise and evaluate the market. </p>
		<p>It took me a very long time, probably a lot longer than it should have, to make this connection as I was telling you earlier. It occurred to me one day as I had sat in class and then at home extremely flustered and upset as my friends and peers all seemed to know where they were going and what they wanted to do when they arrived there. Meanwhile, there was me still wiggling my thumbs over which hobby I was going to convince myself I “wanted” to pursue. It was right then and there that a random spark of thought or maybe it was inspiration from above. I don’t really know but either way, it occurred to me. I sat watching one of the most annoying commercials I had seen more times then I care to admit and could probably repeat every word in it, but this time watching was, for whatever reason, different. As I had sat in my classes all day stressing out about where I would go and what I would do with my life in the future I made an effort, or at least what any high school senior bored in class would call an “effort”, to make that time as productive as I could. Now I’m not one to run very efficiently when I am particularly nervous and agitated about making possibly life long decisions, but I did what I could. As I sat in the back of math class or maybe it was science I don’t really recall much of what happened at school that day, I attempted to think of all the careers that had remotely interested me over the years as well as looking at my family members to try getting a grasp on careers that would be interesting and keep me looking for a new angle and always have a new way to accomplish my goals. I knew I wanted a career that would involve just as much pure blunt force and effort as it would take thinking outside the box. So I went down the line, each…and…every relative I could think of, slowly but surely. I’m sure there was a lot of prejudice that when on during my so called “process of elimination” as I matched relatives I liked and the ones I don’t like so much to different fields of work. To this day though I still couldn’t tell you why, my only explanation is I liked my Grandpa and Uncles best, both marketing and business as well as endodontics stuck out to but more importantly stuck with me. The thought was still running through my head later that day sitting in front of the television like I did every day after school. When that damn commercial popped on and changed my perspective of life. I almost entirely ignored it but for some reason I chose to watch it instead. At the end of it, there was a little Shazam logo in the bottom right corner and that’s when it hit me. I was amazed I had never thought of it before considering I prided myself on paying attention to detail and thinking creatively. And just like Mush Mouth from Fat Albert my brain blurted it out faster than my mouth could move to say it, “Wow! When I see an add on the television I like I can pull out my phone and use an app to pull up a website where I can instantly order it with the exact same sale I saw on T.V.”. As amazed as I was, that’s not really what pulled me towards the world of marketing. I had thought the business world was dull and boring, but after realizing how a single commercial could access so many different platforms and open the world of marketing into numerous areas for all types of people I instantly became interested. In this single revelation I discovered I could take the ideals behind the hobbies I loved with all their details and outside the box thinking and incorporate it into something I had thought was bland and one sided. </p>
		<p>Even though, I didn’t realize it for a very long time, in fact most of my life, each and every time I interacted with a computer I grew one step closer to realizing how I wanted to move forward with my life. Although, there are still many question I continue to ask myself about how I’m going to continue pursuing my career, I know now that I will guide myself to each and every answer I need to discover, and if I keep confidence in myself, I’ll be able to discover things I never thought possible. Now I can move forward with my studies in hope to continue having more inspiration about how I want to develop and transform myself to the person I haven’t realized I am yet, but the person I was made to be.</p>
