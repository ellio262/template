Since none of us had any real experience in creating videos, we were not sure at first how to go about creating and formatting a documentary. However, after a bit of research and some collaboration, we were able to successfully develop a plan that we felt both comfortable and confident in pursing. I feel the audience played a large role in this. I believe this because we were not exactly sure how to appeal to such a wide variety of potential audience members due to the potential appeal of this subject to almost anyone using social media. As we considered the many different topics at our disposal to move forward with, we really made an effort as a group to not only look for a topic in which the largest audience would be able to relate to, but also which topic we were able to best relate to.  I feel the most challenging part of the project was not simply coming up with questions to ask my interviewee, but to come up with well thought out, high quality questions that would both aid our argument and help to keep the interview to an informational neutral view. This was a difficult part for me because as I would write down questions I thought up, I would later go back to re-read them and would constantly find them to lean drastically toward the argument we were giving with our documentary instead of being more on the neutral side allowing the audience to make a decision for themselves. I did not want to appear to be swaying the audience in one way or the other. My approach was not necessarily systematic, other than developing questions and later looking over them in order to make sure I was developing good quality questions. As a group however, we were very systematic in narrowing down which topic we felt would be best suited for the assignment. Our group created a group text in which we communicated frequently about what each individual was doing and what progress we all had made. We also used this frequently to talk about ideas we wanted to include in the video when we were not in class. I believe working in groups for this project was very beneficial for two reasons. First, we were able to break out of working by ourselves like we had all semester and were able to get to know our classmates better. On top of this, it allowed for the labor to be divided between multiple people which kept the stress of the project from becoming overwhelming and made it more fun in my opinion. Overall, our original plan for this project is exactly how we went about getting it done. Aside from a few minor tweaks after realizing our time frame and how much we would be able to get done with the rest of our class schedules, the plan for this project was successful. If we were to have had more time, I would have liked to created a more professional looking video and area for shooting our videos. I would have also liked to have been able to incorporate some more creative editing aspects into our final video that we were not able to due to a lack of knowledge with the technology and time restraints.  We made design decisions as a group for the majority of the documentary and we wanted to stick to a somewhat more traditional style documentary with the feel of an interview setting. However, we also added in a few aspects in order to give it a bit of character. \r\n</p>\r\n                        <li><a href=\"course.html\">course <br />retrospective</a></li>\r\n                        <li><a href=\"blog.html\">My Blog</a></li>\r\n                                <p>Blog 1\r\n        Today was the first day of class. It looks like it is going to be challenging but tolerable, and I hope to learn a lot from this class in order to become more successful as a writer. I’m glad we are going to have an opportunity to partake in so many different types of writing styles and research. I feel this is going to help me to expand as a writer and college student exponentially. I was surprised to have gone through an entire power point on the first day of class, but I suppose it’s something I should start getting used to. The topics we talked about were really confusing to me because I had never heard of most of them before and as they were being explained, they all sounded very similar to me and I was struggling to distinguish between them. All in all, I have high hopes for this class and hope to have a successful semester of growth and learning both as a writer and new college student.\r\n</p>\r\n                <p>In-Class Activity 1\r\nThe video we watched in class had a few different purposes. First and foremost, it was meant to us how a common narrative should be written and structured. However, it also served the purpose of giving us new ideas about how we would break away from the very formal style of papers we had written for our rough drafts prior to class. This video also serves to get a major point about the author’s life to the audience in an interesting and different way. It achieves this by involving numerous editing and film techniques in order to give a more dynamic feel. It also has a very open and conversational feel to how the author both tells the story and how there is very little formal structure to the writing of the narrative. By following the lead of this video, I am going to back through my Lived Experiences project and make it both less formal and more personal as if I were talking to someone in an everyday conversation.\r\n</p>\r\n                <p>In-Class Activity 2\r\n        For the mass majority of people in the world, a formal education and personal success tend to go hand in hand. However, as we see clearly in the Social Network, it is not always this way. To me personally, it is most interesting that the majority of the most successful humans throughout history have either been college dropouts or never even attended college at all. It is solidified throughout the Social Network that a formal education is not needed at all to be successful. I believe that there is not any true correlation but rather people believe it is the only to be successful so they strive to succeed in a formal education. As I watched the Social Network, it was made clear that success is truly found when a combination of book smarts and street smarts are combined and put to use in order to stay ahead of the game but to do it in a very calculated way. On top of this, personal success and economic success are two very different areas of thought. This is because personal success is judged by each individual and may have nothing to do with their economic success but rather their success of beating the ones who are competing against them like in the law suit focused on in the Social Network. Overall, I feel that formal education can help anyone gain personal success, but it may not have any effect on their economic success. The success of an individual relies on their ability to combine what they know already with new ideas and ways of thinking in order to do things no one had previously thought of.\r\n</p>\r\n                <p>In-Class Activity 3\r\n        As a whole, this advertisement does a fantastic job of incorporating numerous aspects both visually and audio in order to create an effective add. Using the tagline of “Made in Detroit”, it ties in perfectly with them using the numerous images of the glamorous parts of Detroit like the GM building and MGM casino to create a feeling of glamour and beauty. On top of this, by using Eminem to be the spokesman and voiceover, they add another aspect of hometown pride to the commercial for those who are from the Detroit area. The advertisement is very powerful for those who have a tie to Detroit because it gives the feeling of pride and a new beginning for a city that has been struggling for many years. By combining all these aspects into one comprehensive commercial, it establishes the company as a hometown hero and as someone who is fighting for the revival of the town that put America on wheels. I personally felt extremely proud to be associated with the city after seeing the commercial and it gave me chills.\r\n</p>\r\n                <p>Blog 2\r\n        We began working on our lived experiences project, and I have clearly struggled like everyone else by making my essay too formal for the kind of paper we should be writing. Here’s and example of how I wrote my rough draft. “An experience lived is a lesson learned. All throughout my life I have been exposed to countless new thoughts, experiences, and people that have all had an impact whether large- or small in leading me to where I am now. However, in this age of a world that is immensely saturated in advanced technology nothing more has influenced my decision to begin studying business marketing then computers and their counterparts. Many would not put these two aspects together when they think of objects influencing an individual’s choice in a profession and degree choice. I too did not put these two together initially as I began to brainstorm different kinds of technology that influenced me throughout my life. As I began to realize where and when I had been intrigued by not only marketing, but also business as a whole I concluded that although it wasn’t one solitary piece of technology to influence me all those that impacted me were very closely interconnected. Whether it was the ads themselves or simply the creativity and manipulation now available to use for them or the well planned out and perfectly executed incorporation of computers, phones, and televisions, worldwide marketing and advertising slowly began to stick into my mind. Never in my lifetime had I thought I would be pursuing business and marketing.” As you can see, I have a lot of changes to make to turn this into a narrative.\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n                <p>Blog 3\r\n        After a lot of hard work I think I’ve finally finished my lived experiences paper. I rewrote almost the entire paper and made sure to go through multiple times in order to ensure that I wasn’t being extremely formal and was more like the video we watched in class. The code academy is pretty fun but it can get tedious after a little while, going to have to keep up with that. Now that I’ve got the stress of one paper off my chest, I’m so happy to be rewarded with the new assignment. The cultural analysis project is going to take some thinking in order to come up with a topic I’ll truly care to write about. Better get after it.\r\n</p>\r\n                <p>Blog 4\r\n        Well it wasn’t easy, but I found a topic that I really hope to find out more about. The burden of drugs on the American public is rampant and getting out of control more and more every day! I hope that with this paper I may be able to find some solutions to this issue. I don’t know how I’m feeling about the form of proof reading and peer review in this class though, it feels like everyone just wings it and doesn’t really care to give back much in terms of corrections or thoughts.\r\n</p>\r\n                <p>Blog 5\r\n        Working on my analysis paper has turned out to be a lot more work then I had anticipated, but I’m going to keep working away at it. There is so much different information to interperet I’ve been having trouble deciding what to include and what not to include. The peer reviews from the rough draft haven’t been much help but outside sources have helped me out a lot with narrowing down the view of my paper and deciding what aspects I should focus on tackling. I can’t believe we’ve already written two papers almost, it feels like we just began class last week.\r\n</p>\r\n                <p>Blog 6\r\n        Well after some setbacks and a minor panic attack, the analysis paper is finally finished. It’s been a couple of long nights getting all the finishing touches in order but I’m proud of the paper I’m turning in. Code academy is coming along pretty well so I’m glad I’m on track with that and it’s cool to be learning so many new things about html. This formal research paper looks pretty intimidating, but I have confidence that I’ll be able to put together a solid paper. Time to get back to researching and hours in the library. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n                <p>Blog 7\r\n        Holy cow is there a lot of information I’ve already gathered for this paper! I hope we’ll get some more direction and instruction for this paper since it is so involved. I feel like I’ve grown quite a bit as a writer so far and I hope this paper only increases that growth. I’ve learned some pretty valuable lessons about time management and research that I feel will help me a lot with this paper, and will also help me to be a more successful student all around. The rough draft for this paper was hard to write. I think I need to take some more time and look at exactly what I want to portray through this paper.\r\n</p>\r\n                <p>Blog 8\r\n        Lesson learned. SAVE YOUR WORK. I can’t believe I forgot to save over half of my final paper and had to start almost completely over. I’ve never had so much stress come from one paper before. Another couple of long nights with this paper which is never a fun time. Couldn’t be happier to be done with this assignment. Needless to say I did not enjoy this assignment as much as I had anticipated. I hope the second version of the final copy is as well structured as the first one was, didn’t even have time to proofread it this time.\r\n</p>\r\n                <p>Blog 9\r\n        Week eleven already? This semester is flying by it feels like. Maybe it’s because we always have another assignment due and I’m just too busy to realize the days are going by. The new remix project looks awesome though! I can’t wait to get a chance to go away from the classic essay version of school and be able to make a video presentation. I’m also excited to work with some of the students in class since we don’t have a lot of interaction most days.\r\n</p>\r\n                <p>Blog 10\r\n        Almost done with the project and it’s almost Thanksgiving what more could you ask for? This project has been both fun and challenging since I don’t have a lot of experience with video editing or the production of documentaries. My team and I have developed a solid strategy to creating this project and so far everything has gone to plan except for a few minor tweaks to the plan. The video is looking solid and my group is working well together, I’d say this is the most successful assignment yet. This retrospective project however looks a little intimidating to me. Let’s see how it goes!\r\n</p>\r\n                <p>Blog 11\r\n        Back from break and time to get the rest of this class project done. I mixed up the due dates for our final paper and thought it was due today, turns out I’m ahead of schedule now. Almost finished with code academy and I couldn’t be happier. I’ve learned a lot of new things about html but I can’t wait to be finished with this. I hope everyone else in class is on board to get going on our class website because I would hate for my grade to be effected because a few students decided to slack off. This assignment is a lot less intimidating now that I’ve been given some explanation to it and seeing people work together it’s giving me hope. One more week to go, let’s see how well the class can work together as one big group instead of individuals or small secluded groups. Fingers crossed!\r\n</p>\r\n                <p>Blog 12\r\n        Last week of class and I can’t believe it. This semester has flown by but I’ve learned a lot of valuable lessons along the way that I’m sure will take to great places throughout my college and professional careers. The papers I’ve written have really made me think about my major choice and how I want to proceed with my studies next semester. Don’t worry though, no matter what I do I won’t forget to save all my work again. It’s turned into a sixth sense now and I don’t think I’ll ever trust a computer again after the last fiasco. It is bittersweet to have to say goodbye after learning so much in this class. Not just about writing but also about life in general and myself. It has been a great experience and I can’t wait to see how the class assignment turns out in the end. Until next time, it’s been a great ride!\r\n</p>\r\n                </ul>\r\n                </header>\r\n                <main>\r\n                        <h1>My Blog</h1>\r\n                        <p>My Name is Richard Elliott.
