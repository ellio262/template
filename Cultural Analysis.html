			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>The following analysis will focus on the issues of drug use and its related violence in the cities of the United States. As a basis of this paper, I will use the show Breaking Bad to help illustrate the numerous social issues associated with drug use, specifically methamphetamine, and the groups of people and violence that is closely associated with this drug. Drug use in America is an epidemic and it can become interlinked with numerous different parts of our society very easily. However, there is hope for the epidemic as police agencies and social help groups are fighting for an end to the War on Drugs. With more help from the government in helping to cure the sick and drug addicted people of the nation, I foresee a bright future with very little drug use and an even smaller will to try illicit drugs by todayâ€™s youth. As the War on Drugs wages on, the need is not more money into the war but rather legitimate medical help for those plagued by addiction. </p>
