	Today was the first day of class. It looks like it is going to be challenging but tolerable, and I hope to learn a lot from this class in order to become more successful as a writer. I’m glad we are going to have an opportunity to partake in so many different types of writing styles and research. I feel this is going to help me to expand as a writer and college student exponentially. I was surprised to have gone through an entire power point on the first day of class, but I suppose it’s something I should start getting used to. The topics we talked about were really confusing to me because I had never heard of most of them before and as they were being explained, they all sounded very similar to me and I was struggling to distinguish between them. All in all, I have high hopes for this class and hope to have a successful semester of growth and learning both as a writer and new college student.

The video we watched in class had a few different purposes. First and foremost, it was meant to us how a common narrative should be written and structured. However, it also served the purpose of giving us new ideas about how we would break away from the very formal style of papers we had written for our rough drafts prior to class. This video also serves to get a major point about the author’s life to the audience in an interesting and different way. It achieves this by involving numerous editing and film techniques in order to give a more dynamic feel. It also has a very open and conversational feel to how the author both tells the story and how there is very little formal structure to the writing of the narrative. By following the lead of this video, I am going to back through my Lived Experiences project and make it both less formal and more personal as if I were talking to someone in an everyday conversation.

	For the mass majority of people in the world, a formal education and personal success tend to go hand in hand. However, as we see clearly in the Social Network, it is not always this way. To me personally, it is most interesting that the majority of the most successful humans throughout history have either been college dropouts or never even attended college at all. It is solidified throughout the Social Network that a formal education is not needed at all to be successful. I believe that there is not any true correlation but rather people believe it is the only to be successful so they strive to succeed in a formal education. As I watched the Social Network, it was made clear that success is truly found when a combination of book smarts and street smarts are combined and put to use in order to stay ahead of the game but to do it in a very calculated way. On top of this, personal success and economic success are two very different areas of thought. This is because personal success is judged by each individual and may have nothing to do with their economic success but rather their success of beating the ones who are competing against them like in the law suit focused on in the Social Network. Overall, I feel that formal education can help anyone gain personal success, but it may not have any effect on their economic success. The success of an individual relies on their ability to combine what they know already with new ideas and ways of thinking in order to do things no one had previously thought of.

	As a whole, this advertisement does a fantastic job of incorporating numerous aspects both visually and audio in order to create an effective add. Using the tagline of “Made in Detroit”, it ties in perfectly with them using the numerous images of the glamorous parts of Detroit like the GM building and MGM casino to create a feeling of glamour and beauty. On top of this, by using Eminem to be the spokesman and voiceover, they add another aspect of hometown pride to the commercial for those who are from the Detroit area. The advertisement is very powerful for those who have a tie to Detroit because it gives the feeling of pride and a new beginning for a city that has been struggling for many years. By combining all these aspects into one comprehensive commercial, it establishes the company as a hometown hero and as someone who is fighting for the revival of the town that put America on wheels. I personally felt extremely proud to be associated with the city after seeing the commercial and it gave me chills.

	We began working on our lived experiences project, and I have clearly struggled like everyone else by making my essay too formal for the kind of paper we should be writing. Here’s and example of how I wrote my rough draft. “An experience lived is a lesson learned. All throughout my life I have been exposed to countless new thoughts, experiences, and people that have all had an impact whether large- or small in leading me to where I am now. However, in this age of a world that is immensely saturated in advanced technology nothing more has influenced my decision to begin studying business marketing then computers and their counterparts. Many would not put these two aspects together when they think of objects influencing an individual’s choice in a profession and degree choice. I too did not put these two together initially as I began to brainstorm different kinds of technology that influenced me throughout my life. As I began to realize where and when I had been intrigued by not only marketing, but also business as a whole I concluded that although it wasn’t one solitary piece of technology to influence me all those that impacted me were very closely interconnected. Whether it was the ads themselves or simply the creativity and manipulation now available to use for them or the well planned out and perfectly executed incorporation of computers, phones, and televisions, worldwide marketing and advertising slowly began to stick into my mind. Never in my lifetime had I thought I would be pursuing business and marketing.” As you can see, I have a lot of changes to make to turn this into a narrative.
